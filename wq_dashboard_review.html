# Overview of comments

class: middle, center, inverse

## What do you think is the purpose of this application? In other words, what questions or management needs does the application address?

* To quickly see what areas of TB are and are not __meeting their intended targets__ and to __explore underlying causes__.
* The dashboard provides exploratory data analysis of monitoring data to help a user __understand how the report card is scored__.
* Let people know __how Tampa Bay's nitrogen management strategy works__, how it's calculated, and the outcomes for water quality monitoring. It can also be used to __investigate which factors__ (or algal species) are driving certain outcomes for the management matrix.
* __When, where and how__ water quality is changing in Tampa Bay- so you can __look into why__ if necessary.

## Who is the intended audience? Should we contact specific people to get their feedback/identify needs? 

* __Government agencies__; large entities that contribute to water pollution issues; __decision-makers__ or large players in the Tampa Bay watershed.
* Mostly __resource managers__ and technical county/city staff who may be asked about TB WQ status and trends by executive staff, __elected officials__, and members of the __public__.
* __Scientists__, __consultants__, __managers__ and __decision makers__
* I suggest additional involvement of 1) Those involved in large-scale monitoring program QA like the EPA LTER program; and 2) Those involved in "big-data" analytical techniques

## Please rate the interface for ease of use, e.g., instructions were clear, information was easily navigated, etc.

## What is the best feature of the dashboard?

* The __interactivity__ of the dashboard. Being able to look at most of the data in one place without having to move between several different panes.
* The __multiple views__ of long, time series trends are a simple and incredibly effective way of __summarizing__ this major status and trend measure.
* I like being able to go all the way __down to the site level__ in the 4th tab.
* Data is __accessible__ and __interactive__
* It gives a __quick high level snapshot__ of conditions relative to targets and also allows users to go a bit more in-depth.

---

class: middle, center, inverse

## What is the worst feature of the dashboard?

* Even though it's a small gripe, the __font color__ made it a little bit difficult to read.
* __Instructions can be lengthy__. That detail should be available into how the science works/how decisions were made, but a quick start version for more casual users on simply how to interpret the graphs should be available and placed front and center.
* The Site Trends is __very busy__ with too much data, and it doesn't achieve the purpose of seeing what sites might be influencing a segment's attainment.
* Can be TMI for those not initiated - could be __overwhelming__ I think
* Having some __lag__ between the mouse movement and the changes wanted
* The first page, Overview, __has a lot of words__ and the format is kind of dry. It does not draw me in and make me want to further explore the pages

---

class: middle, center, inverse

## Did you encounter any errors or unexpected issues that we need to fix/address?

* When zoomed into the box and whisper graphs, there are __two separate sets__ of quartile, outlier, maximum, etc. points.
* No. But normally I'd test a web-based application on common __mobile devices__ before saying I'm completely satisfied.
* I'm not sure if it's just the size of my computer screen but the __legends__ on the map on Tab 1 were all __over-lapping__ and I couldn't read them. 
* I had a question about "missing" secchi depths, but Marcus addressed it
* There was a bit of a __lag__ for loading the pages.

---

class: middle, center, inverse

## Are there any features you think are unnecessary or any features we should add?

* I think a possible explainer __YouTube video__ might be helpful. A short 2-5 minute video of just a screen recording that goes through each tab.
* Will the dashboard eventually be extended to include any __other water quality parameters__?
* I would like to see more on __nutrients__, if available
* Add other WQ parameters like TN and TP and allow __correlations__ between different parameters over different timescales and stations. And the final butter on my biscuit would be to allow users to fit certain (BUT appropriate) __trend lines or smoother functions__ like LOESS curves to plots like Chl-a versus TN.

---

## Anything else not covered above that we should know about?

* I'd have somebody __independently review__ the dashboard generation process for any errors of omission.
* When viewing on a smaller computer screen (15" laptop) the y-axis __labels start to overlap__: can we wrap them to two lines to prevent overlapping among panels?
* No tools or insight into the __Why__?

## Please provide an overall assessment score for the dashboard that summarizes your responses to the above questions.

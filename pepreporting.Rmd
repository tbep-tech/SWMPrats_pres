## AGENDA FOR TODAY
]

1. Overview of open science philosophy

1. Application to TBEP and partner reporting products

1. Tech transfer to other NEPs

1. PEP reporting tools: `pepreporting` R package

1. Discussion, next steps

## GOALS FOR TODAY
]

1. Vibe check: do we like these approaches? 

1. Are there additional tools to add? 

1. How could the Monitoring Collaborative use these tools? 

--

<h3 style="text-align: center;">
We are not revisiting past decisions, but understanding how the tools use these decisions and could be used to answer future questions!

# Open Science: why, what, and how

---

class: middle, center

## The research-management divide

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/divide2.png")
```

---

class: middle, center

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/michener.png')
```

.footnote[Michener et al. 1997 Ecol. App. 7(1):330-342.]

---

class: middle, center

## Open science can bridge this divide

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/bridge.png")
```

class: middle, center

### The practice of science in such a way that others can **collaborate** and **contribute**, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are **freely available**, under terms that enable **reuse**, **redistribution** and **reproduction** of the research and its underlying data and methods

### Date are __F__indable, __A__ccessible, __I__nteroperable, and __R__esuable

## TECH TRANSFER
]

* No need to rebuild the wheel!
--

* Leverage other methods (technical foundation) AND tools (analysis workflows) using FAIR principles
--

* Increase collaboration among NEPs, we are a community that should be open and learn from each other

## PAST DECISIONS
]

* Consider existing LTM datasets that can be used to assess progress in attaining CCMP goals (*Goal: Clean Waters*)
--

* Spatial divisions of Peconic Estuary to applying numeric thresholds
--

* Relevant thresholds and how to quantify (median vs. mean)

--
* Stoplight graphic for public-facing documents, update annually

## REPORTING
]

* Translate segment water quality conditions into annual reporting categories to inform/prioritize management actions towards CCMP goals
--

* In Tampa...

<span style="color:#33FF3B; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Stay the Course__</span>: Continue planned projects. Report data via annual progress reports and Baywide Environmental Monitoring Report. 

<span style="color:#F9FF33; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Caution__</span>: Review monitoring data and nitrogen loading estimates. Begin/continue TAC and Management Board development of specific management recommendations.

<span style="color:#FF3333; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__On Alert__</span>: Finalize development and implement appropriate management actions to get back on track.

## EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES
]

* Futuree discussions may involve additional decisions on appropriate targets 
* AND if the targets vary by estuary segments, e.g., by salinity gradients
--

* The `pepreporting` package was built with this in mind...
```{r, echo = T}
segs <- c('Western', 'Central', 'Eastern')
newtrgs <- tibble(
  bay_segment = factor(segs, levels = segs),
  name = factor(segs, levels = segs),
  sd_thresh = c(5.5, 6.5, 7.5),
  chla_thresh = c(6, 5.5, 5)
)
```

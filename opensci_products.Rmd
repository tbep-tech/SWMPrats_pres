### The practice of science in such a way that others can **collaborate** and **contribute**, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are **freely available**, under terms that enable **reuse**, **redistribution** and **reproduction** of the research and its underlying data and methods

class: top, center

.center[
## SHORT-TERM
]

* Automated reporting of CCMP indicators
* Made available through TBEP website, keeping entire workflow __transparent__ and __accessible__

--

.center[
## LONG-TERM
]

* Develop a community of practice to make better science in less time
* Training workshops and online resources
* Open science TAC subcomittee

---

class: top, center

.center[
## WE ARE WELL UNDERWAY
]

* Workshop September 2019
* First day at TBEP Nov. 1, 2019
* Initial open science products

# FOR EVERY INDICATOR, A NEW WORKFLOW

## THE OLD WAY

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/badflow1.png')
```

---
class: top, center

## THE OLD WAY

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/badflow2.png')
```

---
class: top, center

## THE OLD WAY

* Hefty license fees for software
* Time consuming and prone to error
* Opaque, disconnected, and undiscoverable workflow
* Missed opportunities to engage the broader community

---
class: top, center

## THE NEW WAY

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/flow1.png')
```

---
class: top, center

## THE NEW WAY

```{r, out.width="100%"}

```

---
class: top, center

## THE NEW WAY

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/flow3.png')
```

---
class: top, center

## THE NEW WAY

* Transparent and reproducible methods
* Discoverable products that can engage others
* Automated data QAQC and integration with reporting
* New front-facing web products, both static and interactive

## TIDAL CREEK ASSESSMENT
]

### Creeks assigned to categories within a management framework:

<span style="color:#33FF3B; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Target__</span>: At or below nitrogen concentrations that protect individual creek types within the larger population of creeks.

<span style="color:#F9FF33; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Caution__</span>: A site-specific early warning concentration that an individual creek may be trending towards a eutrophic condition and can help prioritize where management actions should begin to identify actions to prevent a threshold exceedance.

<span style="color:#FFA500; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Action__</span>: A concentration indicating a management action level that identifies a potential degradation point as an impetus to develop site-specific management actions.

<span style="color:#FF3333; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #333;">__Threshold__</span>: A concentration indicating that regulatory actions are needed to confirm the impairment and identify remediative actions for the creek watershed.

## MORE TO COME

* Tidal creeks include several additional indicators as context
* Two-pager or other summary document
* Automated integration with data sources

--

### __*Next indicators to tackle are nekton and benthic indices*__

## TAC ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

* An application must meet the needs of those that require science to inform decisions
* Development requires two-way exchange of ideas

--

### __*How could managers use these data?*__

--

### __*How could these products support policy?*__

--

### __*Let's create an open science subcommittee!*__

# Conclusions and next steps

## Long-term trends

* Overall, nutrients have decreased and segrasses have recovered

## Concerning recent changes

* Recent increases in chlorophyll, increases in diatom density
* Temperature increase and salinity decrease in the past ten years
* HAB increases in some locations, possibly linked to temperature and salinity, also maybe linked to methodology changes

# Conclusions and next steps (for chl-a)

## Role of hydrogy

* Chlorophyll trends are linked to many factors, not just nutrients
* Hydrology may be a confounding factor driving trends

## Seasonal differences

* All previous analyses evaluated annual trends, as in the NMC action plan
* Seasonal differences are also very important to consider, i.e., when are exceedances happening and what's driving them?

# Analysis goals

## Explore alternative methods

* Use of Weighted Regression to evaluate past trends ()

* Modelling chlorophyll as a function of time, discharge (flow), and season

* Ability to extract "flow-normalized" to remove hydrologic influence

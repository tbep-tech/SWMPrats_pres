# Project goals 

## 1) Develop a regionally-coordinated, standardized red tide impact assessment method

## 2) Evaluate and make recommendations for optimizing reponse efforts

# Project goals 

## 1) Develop a regionally-coordinated, standardized red tide impact assessment method

### - Identify data needs
### - Establish assessment endpoints
### - Develop analysis workflow (inputs/outputs, data dictionary, metadata)

# Project goals 

## 2) Evaluate and make recommendations for optimizing response efforts

### - Allow for open communication
### - Coordinate efforts and minimize redundancies
### - An online decision-support tool?

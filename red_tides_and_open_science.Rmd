### The practice of science in such a way that others can **collaborate** and **contribute**, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are **freely available**, under terms that enable **reuse**, **redistribution** and **reproduction** of the research and its underlying data and methods

# Dealing with sensitive data:

## - Anonymyize or generalize information with readily-available tools

## - Don't be open when it's impractical!

## - Or just embrace the openness..

# Project goals 

## 1) Develop a regionally-coordinated, standardized red tide impact assessment method

## 2) Evaluate and make recommendations for optimizing reponse efforts

# Project goals 

## 1) Develop a regionally-coordinated, standardized red tide impact assessment method

### - Identify priority metrics
### - Link metrics to data
### - Develop analysis workflow (inputs/outputs, data dictionary, metadata)

# Project goals 

## 2) Evaluate and make recommendations for optimizing response efforts

### - Allow for open communication
### - Coordinate efforts and minimize redundancies
### - An online decision-support tool?

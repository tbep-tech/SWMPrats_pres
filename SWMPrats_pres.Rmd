# The need for open science at NERRS

#### NERRS researchers, managers, technicians, and stakeholders need more quantitative tools for handling these data: 

* Understand regional and national trends while retaining the ability to determine local trends

* Train users

* Maintain a versatile and evolving data analysis approach

* Create a community of practice

# Genesis of SWMPrats

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/bg_main.jpg')
```

#### One-day training workshop at 2014 annual meeting

* Attended by over 70 NERRS staff, representing 19 of 28 reserves

* General focus on time series analysis, simple application with SWMP data

* Pre/post workshop materials including An R package for SWMP

# SWMPrats.net

A website with information and tools for SWMP data analysis

```{r, echo = F, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/swmprats_home.png')
```

---

# SWMPrats.net: The SWMPr package

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics('figure/swmpr_logo.png')
```

SWMPr is an open-source R package for working with SWMP data

```{r eval = F}
# install/load from R
install.packages('SWMPr')
library(SWMPr)
```


* Dealing with "bad" data

* Subsetting by date ranges, parameters

* Combining data from different sites

* Standardizing time steps

* ...not to mention the analysis

# SWMPrats.net: Interactive web apps

.pull-left[
The most common question - what's happened at my site over time? 

Three Shiny applications allow users to visualize trends in SWMP data, these apps allow *reactive* use of SWMPr functions

# Why should you care?

* These tools will be used! To date, SWMPr has had over __13k__ downloads!

--

* Increased mileage of data - more users looking at more questions = more answers!

--

* Develop a community of practice - shared workflows promote collaboration and encourage group learning!

--

* More group learning means collective benefits for all - more efficient use of resources!

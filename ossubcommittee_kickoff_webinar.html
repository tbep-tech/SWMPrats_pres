### The practice of science in such a way that others can **collaborate** and **contribute**, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are **freely available**, under terms that enable **reuse**, **redistribution** and **reproduction** of the research and its underlying data and methods

&gt; "Few active researchers see data stewardship as their core business, especially because current incentive systems discourage data sharing and entrench an archaic and almost exclusively narrative-based culture of scholarly communication."

&gt; "Many top universities are starting to see that the costs of not sharing data are significant and greater than the associated risks. Data stewardship offers excellent returns on investment."

&gt; "The key is to build capacity, enable groups to collaborate nationally and internationally and share good practices so that good data stewardship becomes the rule, not the exception."

# Roles and responsibilities of subcommittee

---

class: top, left

# Why do we need a subcommittee?

1. Products should not be created in a vacuum

1. Open science is a new way of thinking for many

---

class: top, left 

# Subcommittee roles and responsibilities

1. Support development of open science products at TBEP

1. Rank priority research areas for developing open science products

1. Facilitate training activities

---

class: top, left 

# 1. Support development of open science products at TBEP

* Who is the intended audience and are we engaging them?
* How well does the product address identified needs? 
* Is the design intuitive, does it work as expected, should features be added?

---

class: top 

# 2. Rank priority research areas for developing open science products

* Topics actively under development
     + Water quality report card
     + Tidal creeks dashboard
* Anticipated products for remainder of 2020
     + Nekton index
     + Benthic index
     + Others?

# 2019 OS workshop feedback

&gt; ### " __Great exposure__ to a range tools, together with a solid intro of the philosophical underpinnings of open science"

&gt; ### "I was unaware of some of the data reporting capabilities that now exist. __It's exciting!__"

&gt; ### "I have a much __better understanding__ of open science, and absolutely know where to look for resources."

---

# 2019 OS workshop feedback

&gt; ### "I really liked the interactive nature of presentations. However, as a beginner in coding and open science at times __I felt it moved at a very fast pace.__"

&gt; ### "I liked the group discussion at the end of the workshop. I would have liked to have __more hands-on__ with Rstudio and Github."

&gt; ### "This was a good introduction, but I think a __hands-on follow-up__ is needed."

# 3. Facilitate training activities

* What topics should we cover?
* When and how often are training events happening?
* Where does it happen?

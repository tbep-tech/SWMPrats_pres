Read_This_Annual 

Data are updated on the last day of a month, loading the previous month's data. 
For example, a file generated on the last day of July contains data for months 
01-06.

After an entire year of data has been downloaded, an annual file is created and the 
monthly files deleted.  This will occur in January, consolidating the previous 
January thru December of the previous year.

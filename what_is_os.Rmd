# Open science

---

class: middle, center

### The practice of science in such a way that others can **collaborate** and **contribute**, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are **freely available**, under terms that enable **reuse**, **redistribution** and **reproduction** of the research and its underlying data and methods

# Principle 1

---

class: middle

# `r fa('table')` Open data 

## - Public availability of data
## - Reusability and transparent workflows
## - Data provenance and metadata

---

class: middle, center, inverse

# Principle 2

---

class: middle

# `r fa("cogs")` Open process

## - Iterative methods using reproducible workflows
## - Collaboration with colleagues using web-based tools
## - Leveraging external, open-source applications

---

class: middle, center, inverse

# Principle 3

---

class: middle

# `r fa("book")` Open products

## - Interactive web products for communication
## - Dynamic documents with source code
## - Integration with external networks for discoverability

---

class: middle, center, inverse

# Open science is a process that goes beyond using freely available software

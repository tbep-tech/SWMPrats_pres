## DISCUSSION ITEMS

* IT support/long-term maintenance
   * Problem: OS software typically doesn't have dedicated IT staff or professional support that other platforms offer
   * Problem: OS developers have no incentive to follow best practices for software dev
   * But see [https://ropensci.org/](https://ropensci.org/)

## DISCUSSION ITEMS

* R package dependencies
   * Problem: Software continues to develop, risking backwards incompatibility
   * Problem: R is a complex network of dependencies, making the entire system vulnerable to deprecation
   * Resources for addressing the problem: [groundhog](http://datacolada.org/95), [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html)
   * Also be aware the top developers are thinking about this problem...
